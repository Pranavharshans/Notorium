**Last Update:** 2025-04-09 10:33:00

## Implemented Features

### Add: Category-Specific Note Templates
**Date:** 2025-04-09 10:33:00

**Description:** Implemented a template selection feature that allows users to choose from different lecture categories (Programming, Mathematics, Science, Humanities, Business, Law, Medicine, Engineering, and General Knowledge) when generating notes. Each category has specialized instructions for the AI to format and structure the notes appropriately. Added a category dropdown in the NewLectureView component and modified the Gemini service to handle category-specific note generation.

### Add: Pause Recording Feature
**Date:** 2025-04-09 09:36:00

**Description:** Implemented a pause recording feature, allowing users to pause and resume the recording. Added a pause/resume button to the UI. Modified the recording service to handle pausing and resuming the recording.

### Add: Typing Animation Effect
**Date:** 2025-04-08 21:08:00

**Description:** Enhanced the typing animation on the landing page to cycle through multiple messages: "Recording lecture...", "Transcribing...", and "Summarizing notes...". Added a blinking cursor effect using CSS animation with a thin vertical line that matches the text color. Adjusted typing speed to 100ms per character for more natural pacing and increased pause between messages to 2 seconds for better readability. Added proper state management to reset animation between messages. Added a fixed height container to prevent layout shifts. Styled the animation to match the existing design with text-2xl size and gray-600 color.


### Fix: Word Animation Container Stability
**Date:** 2025-04-08 15:31:00

**Description:** Fixed the word rotation animation in WordRotate component to eliminate text shifting and cropping. Made the gradient text transparent by removing the solid background color, allowing background lines to show through. Removed the container div and applied its styles directly to the motion.h1 element. Further optimized the container width (190px) and removed horizontal padding to create a tighter fit around the rotating words. Added `align-middle` to the span containing the WordRotate component to adjust its vertical alignment. Made spacing consistent by using gap-2 for both "learn [word]" and "not harder" pairs. Added gradient text effect with custom colors (blue, purple, pink, cyan) and reduced the blur radius of the gradient overlay from 1rem to 0.5rem to improve the visibility of the background lines. Maintained left-alignment to prevent text movement during transitions.


### Fix: Sidebar Layout Spacing
**Date:** 2025-04-07 21:35:28

**Description:** Fixed spacing issues in the sidebar layout by reducing the sidebar width to `w-20` and centering all items. Removed left margins (`ml-4`) and ensured consistent spacing between sidebar elements. This eliminates unwanted gaps between the sidebar and notes list components.

### Code Refactoring: Component Organization
**Date:** 2025-04-07 21:24:28

**Description:** Refactored the HomePage component in `src/app/home/page.tsx` to improve code organization. Extracted UI components into separate files under the layout directory. Resolved merge conflicts and maintained the latest functionality including bookmarking, categories, and note enhancement features. The refactoring improves maintainability while preserving all existing features.

### Implement Bookmarking/Favoriting Notes
**Date:** 2025-04-07 21:12:31

### Fix: Reduce Icon Sidebar Width
**Date:** 2025-04-07 21:01:50

**Description:** Reduced the width of the leftmost icon sidebar from `w-60` to `w-20` in `src/app/home/page.tsx`. Centered the items within the sidebar and removed internal left margins to reduce the empty space between the icon sidebar and the notes list column.

### AI Provider Toggle: Gemini and Groq Integration
**Date:** 2025-04-06 08:42:02

**Description:** Added support for switching between Google's Gemini and Groq AI models for note generation and enhancement. Implemented a new `AIProviderService` that manages the provider selection and abstracts the API calls. Added UI controls in both the note generation and enhancement interfaces to toggle between providers. The selected provider persists during the session and affects both initial note generation and subsequent enhancements.

### UI Refinement: Minimalist Note Display & Font Update
**Date:** 2025-04-05 22:54:23

**Description:** Modified the `src/components/ui/note-display.tsx` component to adopt a more minimalist aesthetic similar to `ui5.png`. Removed the background, border, and rounded corners from the main note container. Adjusted heading typography (size, weight, margins) and removed the `prose-slate` variant. Updated the global font by modifying `tailwind.config.mjs` to use 'Inter' and the default sans-serif stack, replacing the previous Geist Sans font for a cleaner look closer to the target UI.

---

### Notes List Column
**Date:** 2025-04-03 19:38:33

**Description:** Added a middle column to the main layout (`src/app/home/page.tsx`) to display a list of notes, similar to the design in `ui3.png`. Created a new component `src/components/ui/notes-list.tsx` for this purpose, including placeholder notes and basic interaction.

### UI Improvement: Notes Above Transcript with "See More"
**Date:** 2025-04-03 22:53:28

**Description:** Modified the `src/app/home/page.tsx` component. In the 'My Notes' view, the Notes section is now displayed above the Transcript section. The transcript is initially truncated to 300 characters with a "See More" / "See Less" button to expand/collapse the full text.

---

### Fix: Markdown Rendering for Notes
**Date:** 2025-04-03 23:04:52

**Description:** Installed and configured the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin. Created `tailwind.config.mjs` and added the plugin. Applied the `prose` class to the `ReactMarkdown` containers in `src/app/home/page.tsx`. Removed conflicting custom styles for `.generated-notes` from `src/app/globals.css` to ensure correct styling of Markdown content by the typography plugin.

---

### UI Overhaul: Sidebar, Notes List, and Note Display
**Date:** 2025-04-06 09:47:00

**Description:** Revised the user interface to match the design of the target UI (`ui7.png`). Updated the sidebar styling in `src/app/home/page.tsx`, modified the `NotesList` component (`src/components/ui/notes-list.tsx`) to improve the notes list style, and updated the `NoteDisplay` component (`src/components/ui/note-display.tsx`) to match the target UI's note display area style.

---

### Categories List
**Date:** 2025-04-06 09:55:00
**Description:** Implemented a categories list in the sidebar, displaying the categories based on the tags of the notes. The categories are dynamically fetched from the backend and displayed with their respective counts.

---

### UI Update: Login Page
**Date:** 2025-04-08 13:55:00

**Description:** Updated the login page (`src/app/page.tsx`) to match the new design. Modified the heading to display "Learn [word]," on a single line (with proper spacing and a comma after the rotating word cycling through "faster", "easier", "better", "deeper") and "not harder" on the second line. Added a multi-color gradient effect to the rotating word using the GradientText component. Changed the heading font to Roboto (bold weight 700). Replaced the BackgroundPaths component with the new Tiles component and added a curved fade-out effect using a radial gradient overlay (`[background:radial-gradient(100%_100%_at_50%_0%,transparent_30%,white_70%)]`). Fixed alignment issues by adding baseline alignment and proper spacing using gap-2. Maintained the reduced heading font size and other styling changes.
