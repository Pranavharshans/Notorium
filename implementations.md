- Moved the indicator to the top-left corner

- Added a subtle shadow and background blur for better visibility

### Profile Page Usage Display Update (2025-04-29 06:14:00 Asia/Calcutta)
- Fixed display issue where AI Enhancements quota was not showing correct values due to a property name mismatch (`enhancesRemaining` vs `remaining`).
- Updated Recording Minutes and AI Enhancements sections in the user profile (`src/app/profile/page.tsx`) to display usage as "X used / Y total" instead of just the remaining amount.
- Exported `QUOTA_LIMITS` constant from `quota-service.ts` to be used directly in the profile page for calculating total limits.

### Switched to OpenRouter AI Provider (2025-04-28 11:27:00 Asia/Calcutta)

- Implemented OpenRouter service with the following features:

  * Maintains same note generation and enhancement functionality
- Updated components to use the new OpenRouter service
- Improved API endpoint organization

### Standardized Note Card Size (2025-04-25 01:12:00 Asia/Calcutta)
- Applied a fixed height of 200px to the `NoteItem` component in `src/components/ui/notes-list.tsx` for consistent card size.
- Added a thin border (`border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700`) for visual separation.
- Reorganized note card layout:
  * Title at the top
  * Tags and timestamp row immediately below title
  * Note content with 5-line truncation filling the remaining space

### Reduced Sidebar Spacing (2025-04-25 11:47:00 Asia/Calcutta)
- Reduced padding between the "My Notes" heading and the search bar in the notes sidebar (`NotesSidebar.tsx` and `NotesList.tsx`) for a more compact UI.

### Removed Add Note Button (2025-04-25 14:16:00 Asia/Calcutta)
- Removed the add note button from the top right of the NotesList component.

### NoteDisplay Bug Fix (2025-04-25 10:11:00 Asia/Calcutta)
- Fixed TypeError in NoteDisplay component where `onTitlesExtracted` was being called without being provided
- Made `onTitlesExtracted` prop optional and added conditional check before calling
- This prevents errors when the parent component doesn't need title extraction functionality

### Billing Details Collection (2025-04-23 13:21:00 Asia/Calcutta)
- Removed custom billing details page and integrated DodoPayments' hosted checkout flow.
- Updated the pricing page to directly create the subscription and redirect to DodoPayment's checkout page.

- Fixed product ID handling in checkout process

### Firestore Rule Fix (Quota Update) (4/17/2025, 12:12 AM)
- Removed `debug()` call from the quota update rule in `firestore.rules`.
- This resolves the "Missing or insufficient permissions" error encountered when incrementing recording usage after stopping a recording.
- The `debug()` function, while useful in the simulator, is not recommended for production rules and was likely interfering with rule evaluation.
