Last updated: 2025-04-25 14:16:00 (Asia/Calcutta, UTC+5:30)

## Implemented Features
### Standardized Note Card Size (2025-04-25 01:12:00 Asia/Calcutta)
- Applied a fixed height of 200px to the `NoteItem` component in `src/components/ui/notes-list.tsx` for consistent card size.
- Added a thin border (`border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700`) for visual separation.
- Reorganized note card layout:
  * Title at the top
  * Tags and timestamp row immediately below title
  * Note content with 5-line truncation filling the remaining space

### Reduced Sidebar Spacing (2025-04-25 11:47:00 Asia/Calcutta)
- Reduced padding between the "My Notes" heading and the search bar in the notes sidebar (`NotesSidebar.tsx` and `NotesList.tsx`) for a more compact UI.

### Removed Add Note Button (2025-04-25 14:16:00 Asia/Calcutta)
- Removed the add note button from the top right of the NotesList component.

### NoteDisplay Bug Fix (2025-04-25 10:11:00 Asia/Calcutta)
- Fixed TypeError in NoteDisplay component where `onTitlesExtracted` was being called without being provided
- Made `onTitlesExtracted` prop optional and added conditional check before calling
- This prevents errors when the parent component doesn't need title extraction functionality

### Billing Details Collection (2025-04-23 13:21:00 Asia/Calcutta)
- Removed custom billing details page and integrated DodoPayments' hosted checkout flow.
- Updated the pricing page to directly create the subscription and redirect to DodoPayment's checkout page.
- Updated the subscription creation API route to NOT require billing details in the request body.

### NoteView UI Update (2025-04-25 09:23:00 Asia/Calcutta)
- Updated the NoteView component to resemble the Notion UI in light theme.

### Firestore Rule Fix (Quota Update) (4/17/2025, 12:12 AM)
- Removed `debug()` call from the quota update rule in `firestore.rules`.
- This resolves the "Missing or insufficient permissions" error encountered when incrementing recording usage after stopping a recording.
- The `debug()` function, while useful in the simulator, is not recommended for production rules and was likely interfering with rule evaluation.
