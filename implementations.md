## Implemented Features

- **Notes List Column**
  - **Date:** 2025-04-03 19:38:33
  - **Description:** Added a middle column to the main layout (`src/app/home/page.tsx`) to display a list of notes, similar to the design in `ui3.png`. Created a new component `src/components/ui/notes-list.tsx` for this purpose, including placeholder notes and basic interaction.

- **Formatted Output for Generated Notes**
  - **Date:** 2025-04-03 14:19:47
  - **Description:** Updated the output formatting for generated notes. The notes now include distinct sections, bold characters, and large title fonts for an appealing display.

- **UI Improvement: Notes Above Transcript with "See More"**
  - **Date:** 2025-04-03 22:53:28
  - **Description:** Modified the `src/app/home/page.tsx` component. In the 'My Notes' view, the Notes section is now displayed above the Transcript section. The transcript is initially truncated to 300 characters with a "See More" / "See Less" button to expand/collapse the full text.

## Planned Features

- Additional customization options for note formatting.
- Functionality to load and display actual user notes in the Notes List.
- Functionality to load the selected note's content into the main editor area.
