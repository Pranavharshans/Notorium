 Now these principles have worked on a need for me, of thousands of learners that I've taught this to from around the world, so they will work for you too. These three principles are, number one, the Pareto principle. Number two, the Zegarnik effect. Number three, the championship mentality. And as a bonus, I'll also teach you a way to supercharge each of these three principles and use them in a way that I have never heard anyone else on YouTube talk about. So let's start with number one, the Pareto principle. In my first year of university, when I was trying to print in mid-school, I was studying 15 to 20 hours every single day, and a lot of that time was spent on doing my flashcards. I had by the end of the year over 4,000 flashcards for my papers, and I would be spending five, six hours every single day either preparing my flashcards or doing my flashcards. I had this Google sheet that had all the questions on it and I would track how difficult I found it and how many times I got it wrong and what priority it was. I had this sort of elaborate system that I created for managing my flashcards. But at the end of the day, I found that my results were still not that consistent. I was still having to study a lot of hours just to get the grades that I got. And when I actually entered the middle school, that system was just completely unsustainable because the workload was two, three, four times what it was before. And the moral of the story here is that at the end of the day, it still wasn't enough. The reason is because what I was focusing and spending my time on, which was just optimizing my flashcards, wasn't the thing that was going to make the biggest difference. And this is really what the Pareto principle is about. Sometimes it's called the 80-20 rule. The idea is that 80% of the benefit or the impact of something can come from 20% of the time or effort will work. And when you focus your time and attention on the other side, the 80% of things that produce 20% of the impact, it leads to a lot of waste of time, a lot of frustration, it's very annoying, and it very stressful That really how I felt during those first couple of years And I think a great example that was a great principle is if you think about your health there are many things that you can do to optimize your health Like the amount that you sleep what you drinking how often you drinking what foods you eating the specific micro balance you have the type of exercise, the frequency of your exercise, and the way that you support yourself in recovery after the exercise. You can take additional supplements, you can do meditation. This list is so exhausting. It's the entire industry, right? But really, if you just get 20% of those things right, like if you have good sleep, you're drinking, and you're eating reasonably well, and maybe you're doing some kind of light exercise, it doesn't matter the frequency exactly when you're doing just doing some things sometimes, you're 80% going to be there to being pretty healthy and feeling really good about yourself. And when you focus on the other 8% of things that you take every supplement there is off the shelf, but if you're not getting that 20% right, and your sleep is not good, and you're not drinking regularly, then you're going to suffer. It doesn't matter what the other 8% is. And so this is really important when it comes to productivity, because productivity is all about how you manage limited resources, number one resources, and it's limited being your time. You have the same number of hours in a day as Leonardo DiVicci and Michael Land Rover. And so figuring out what's worth doing and what's not worth doing is really the key. And I think an alpha way of thinking about the spread of principle is not that 20% of the things you do contribute to 80% of the results, but it's understanding. If you have a list of 10 things that you need to get done, what it means is that 8 of those 10 things are essentially going to be a waste of time. compared to figuring out what the two that really make the most impact are and then spending your time absolutely crushing those. And I think of the Prado Principle as the fundamental pillar of all productivity because the impact that the Prado Principle has is it allows you to stack your gains. So I want you to imagine that this circle represents you and then this cross represents the goal that you want to achieve. When we just do everything, we don strictly prioritize exactly where we want to spend our time and what going to help us get apes in the way to our goal We end up doing this We spend a lot lot of time doing lots of things moving in many different directions At the end of the day despite being very busy we still not very close to our goal Once we use the Prado principle what happens is that we figure out what the things are that take us towards the goal, and it means the same amount of time or effort, or even less, way to achieve our goal. And we need to look at someone that's using the Prado principle day in, day out of your life, and you see someone living like this. This is the type of person you look at and you think, man, this person is focused. This person has clarity, this person knows the direction they're going. Everything for them feels like it's all laid out. You can see that they're moving purposely towards the goal and you wonder how does they make it look so easy to get so much done It's over up to what you were just squandering when you look at the person that is doing this They're not using pretty much spending their time across the entire 100% then they're very very busy They're floundering that person is trading work. You can see they are flustered They're not they're falling behind and despite being so busy they are wondering why they don't see getting close to the goal So here's the key takeaway for using the principle. The first thing is to actually spend time planning and prioritizing up front If you're really busy and you feel like you don't have enough time to plan and prioritize or use the principle and figure out what is that 20% that produces the impact Then let me tell you this. If planning is costly, non-planning is more costly Nothing is going to kill your productivity more in spending time on things that are a waste of time. But you have to spend the time upfront to figure out what is or is not a waste of time. And this is the second takeaway, is that good prioritization feels bad. Here's a part that most people overlook. If you've got a list of things to do, the items that make it onto your to-do list are already fairly important. If someone says hey have you ever thought about learning how you can juggle flaming swords riding a unicycle while making an origami crane using your tongue Then you might say no I never thought about doing that and I probably never going to think about doing that And unless your future career path is that of a very niche circus performer that item is never going to be important enough to be on your to list Everything that's on our to-do list has already been filtered and shortlisted out, and we have made the decision, this is important enough for me to do. So what that means is that when you go through and figure out the 80% of the things that are not really getting you towards your goal, that are making the biggest impact out of what other things you can be doing, it's going to feel bad to take them off your list because you are actually aware of what you are losing. By not doing this, I am losing out on this. And that feels bad. And so I want to normalize and let you know that when you're prioritizing well, it should feel bad because that means you're making the difficult decisions about what you're willing to lose strategically that helps you spend the time in the way that gets you to your goal. And my final point is to think holistically. Productivity is not just about doing work or studying or planning. Prioritization is about everything you spend your time on. And that means taking a break, spending time with loved ones, engaging in your hobbies, getting good sleep. These are all things that help sustain and rejuvenate. Productivity is anything that helps you get towards your goal. And if you are three weeks into a sprint of not having had any breaks and you've just been studying and working the entire time and you're feeling like you're burning out, And the thing that's going to get in the way of you achieving your goal is the fact that you're burning up or that you're too tired. And so choosing to ignore self-care and recovery is an incredibly unproductive decision. And again, making that decision can feel bad because it's not clearing my backlog of work and study that I need to do. I'm just sitting there resting, wasting time. We have to recognize it's always time. It's actually productive. So if you just use this principle, just the Prado principle, as I've told you and nothing else, already, for a lot of you, this is going to 2 to 3x your productivity pretty much immediately.
