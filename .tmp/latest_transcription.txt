 This is my video. I'm interacting with participants in workshop today. If you don't feel comfortable participating, do know I'm asking as you talk to people next to you who are not to say no, they practice it because I think I'm not going to communicate. So let's get started right away. I'd like to ask you all to read this sentence. And ask you to read the sentence that's most important to me is that you count the number of M's I'll give you just another couple seconds here. Three, two, one. Raise your hand please if you have three and all these F's. Excellent. Wait, did anybody find four? Anybody find five F's? Did anybody find six F's? There's six F's. What two letter word did many of us miss? We'll make sure to get this to you so you can torment your friends and family at later date. When I first was exposed to this every 12 years ago, I'd be found free. And I felt really stupid, so I'd like to start every workshop in the class I teach you is to pass that few minutes. That's not my answer. I do this because this is a perfect analogy for what we're going to talk about today. The vast majority of us in this room, there are some people that say, we're not as effective as you could have been in this activity. We didn't get it right. And the thing is true when it comes to speaking in a club, particularly when spontaneous food is little things that make a big difference in being effective. So today we're going to talk about little things in terms of your attitude, your practice, practice that could change how you feel when you speak in public. We're going to be talking primarily about one type of public speaking, not the type that you plan for in advance, the type that you actually spend time thinking about the slides for, and these are the key notes in the conference presentation, the formal toasts. That's not what we're talking about today. We're talking about spontaneous speaking. When you're in a situation that you're asked to speak off the cuff, and in the moment, what we're going through today is actually the result of a workshop I created here for the NSC. Several years ago, a survey was taken to one of the students, and they said, what sort of Why did you think it helped make you more successful? And at the top of that list was this notion of responding to cold calls. So they're going to go to cold calls. So when the professor might be, those students are going to be a bit of a lot of fun. So as a result of that, this workshop was created in a vast majority of first-year students here at the GSB go through this workshop. So I'm going to talk you through a sort of hybrid version of what they use. The reality is that spontaneous speaking is actually more prevalent than plants can perhaps take the interactions for the dinner and so we say to people who are so much trying to do something. Maybe it's getting feedback from the post-tour students at the detail where you're thinking. It could be a surprise to each other, or finally, it could be during the Q&A session. And by the way, we will take plenty of time to edit our day-tay for Q&A, I love the other questions you have, and I just found other topics we've dated. So our agenda is simple. In order to be an effective communicator, regardless of its plan, you need to have your anxiety. So we'll start there. Second, what we're going to talk about is some ground-based for the interactive people have today, and then finally we're going to get into the part of what we've been covering again, as I said, the last activity, and I So let's get started with anxiety management. 85% of people tell us that they were nervous from speaking in public, and I think the other 50% are lying. And if we can create a situation or we can make that nervous too. In fact, just this past week, a study from Chapman University asked Americans, what are the things you fear most? And among being caught in a surprise terrorist attack by an identity, your identity stolen, was public speaking on the top while I was speaking in front of others. This is my ubiquitous fear, and one that I believe you learned to manage. And I used that for advantage very carefully, because I think anxiety actually helps us because energy helps us focus on what we're doing is important, but we want to manage it. So I'd like to introduce you to a few techniques that we've been working on, because these are based on activities. But before we get there, I'd love to ask you, what does it feel like when you're sitting in the audience watching in the room and having to feel the shadow of a person? It feels uncomfortable. I don't know if you're going to just that moment. It feels very uncomfortable. So what do we do? Now, how do we finally do like what's with somebody's own? Okay, what else does that sound? So what do we do? We sit there and we nod and we smile and we just made it. And so the nervous speaker looking at it is the audience. The audience is the audience. The audience is the audience. So we teach to learn to manage that. It's your kind of thing that your job is to communicate about your audience's plan or soft teams is to make your audience comfortable. Because it's the company that can receive your message. And when I say comfortable, I am not referring to the fact that your message has to be secure coded and nicely but that a huge message But they have to be a place where they can receive it So it incumbent on you as a communicator help your audience to be incompetent We do that by managing our audience So let me introduce you a few techniques that I think you can use fine ways to help you do a lot of them The first has to do with when you begin to feel those anxiety senses. For most people, this happens in the minutes prior to seeing them. In this situation, what happens is many of us begin to feel whatever it is that happens when you make yourself a kiss, or when you're believing the ladies, you get the shame, maybe you get the first fire, and then we start to say to ourselves, oh my goodness, I'm nervous. Uh-oh, they're going to tell I'm nervous. This is not how I am. Just back out, I'll just tell somebody to come out. So research, you know, mindful attention tells us that when we begin to feel those anxiety spits, we simply greet our anxiety and say, hey, this is me, you're nervous. I've got to lose something, we're not spits. And simply by greeting your anxiety and acknowledging that it's normal and natural, that 85% of people tell us they have it. You actually can step the tide of that anxiety spiropractor. It's not necessarily going to reduce the anxiety, but it's stopping and spitting up. So the next time you begin to feel those anxiety spits, take a deep breath and say, this is me, you're anxious. I notice a few of you taking some nervous. There's a hand out there that will come at the end. It has everything that I'm supposed to say. Okay. Take care of the time I'm going to say. In addition to this approach, a technique that was very good. This is a technique that I don't use to research on fake evidence. It has to do with reframing how we see the same situation. Most of us, if we are unrepresented, we feel that we have to do it right. If we feel like we are performing, how many of you have been impacted when singing and dancing about nice little pieces? Okay. Maybe now. We should never be able to do that. I just hear it in the end of the show. It looks like it has to do it. That's great. So, when you're performing over this right, maybe you don't need it. If you don't get turned to the right note for your right time, the right place, it messes up to the audience, it messes up to the people on stage. But when you present, there is no right way, there's so many bad requests that have at least no right way. So we need to look at presenting something other than our real clients. And what I'd like to suggest is what we need to see as a conversation. Right now, I'm having a conversation without a request to be heard, rather than saying I'm coming to you. But it's not enough just to say, this is a conversation. I want to give you some concrete things you can do. First, start with questions. Questions like your very nature or dialogic, they're two-way. What was one of the very first things I did here at Reel? I had you count the number of deaths and raise your hands and ask you a question. That gets your audience involved. It makes it feel to me as the presenter as a period of conversation. So use questions. They can be rhetorical, they can be told, and perhaps I actually want to be a patient. In fact, I used questions when I created an outline to my recitations. Rather than writing bullet points, I used the questions that I'm going to answer in that conversation. If you were to look at my notes for today's talk, you'll see it's just a series of questions. Right now I'm answering the question, how do we manage our anxiety? beyond questions another very useful technique for making us conversational is to use conversational language many nervous speakers distance themselves physically if you've ever seen a nervous speaker present he or she will say something like this welcome i am really excited to be here with you they pull as far away from you as possible because you threaten us speakers you make us nervous so we want to get away from you we do the same thing linguistically we use language that distances ourselves it's not unusual to hear a nervous speaker say something like one must consider the ramifications or today we're going to cover step one step two step three that's very distancing language. To be more conversational, use conversational language. Instead of one must consider, say, this is important to you. We all need to be concerned with, do you hear that inclusive conversational language? It has to do with the pronouns. Instead of step one, step two, step three, first what we need to do is this. The second thing you should consider is here. Use conversational language. So being conversational can also help you manage your anxiety. The third technique I'd like to share is research that I actually started when I was an undergraduate here. I was very fortunate to study with Phil Zimbardo of the Stanford Prison Experiment fame. Many people don't know that Zim actually was instrumental in starting one of the very first shyness institutes in the the world, especially in the country. And I did some research with him that looked at how your orientation to time influences how you react. And what we learned is if you can bring yourself into the present moment, rather than being worried about the future consequences, you can actually be less nervous. Most of us, when we present, are worried about the future consequences. My students are worried they're not going to get the right grade. Some of you are worried you might not get the funding, you might not get the support, you might not get the last that you want. All of those are future states. So if we can bring ourselves into the present moment, we're not going to be as concerned about those future states and therefore we'll be less nervous. There are lots of ways to become present oriented. I know a professional speaker, He's paid $10,000 an hour to speak. It's a good gig. He gets very nervous. He's up in front of crowds of thousands. Behind the stage, what he does is 100 push-ups right before he comes out. You can't be that physically active and not be in the present moment. Now, I'm not recommending all of us go to that level of exertion because he starts out of breath and sweaty. But a walk around the building before you speak that can do it There are other ways If you ever watched athletes perform and get ready to do their event they listen to music They focus on a song or a playlist that helps get them in the moment You can do things as simple as counting backwards from 100 by tough numbers like 17 I'm going to pause because I know people in the room are trying. It gets hard after that third or fourth one, I know. My favorite way to get present-oriented is to say tongue twisters. Saying a tongue twister forces you to be in the moment, otherwise you'll say it wrong. And it has the added benefit of warming up your voice. Most nervous speakers don't warm up their voice. They retreat inside themselves and start saying all these bad things to themselves. So saying a tongue twister can help you be both present-oriented and warm up your voice. Remember I said today we're going to have a lot of participation? I'm going to ask you to repeat after me my favorite tongue twister. And I like this tongue twister because if you say it wrong, you say a naughty word. And I'm going to be listening to see if I hear any naughty words this morning. Repeat after me. It's only three phrases. I slit a sheet. A sheet I slit. And on that slitted sheet I sit. Oh, very good. No shits. Excellent. Very good. Now, in that moment, in that moment, you weren't worried about I'm in front of all these people. This is weird. This guy's having me do it. You were so focused on saying it right and trying to figure out what the naughty word was that you were in the present moment. That's how easy it is. So it's very possible for us to manage our anxiety. We can do it initially by greeting the anxiety when we begin to feel the signs. We can do it when we reframe the situation as a conversation. And we do it when we become present-oriented. Those are three of many tools that exist to help you manage your anxiety. If you have questions about other ways, I'm happy to chat with you. And at the end, I'm going to point you to some resources that you can refer to to help you find additional sources for you. So let's get started on the core part of what we're doing today, which is how to feel more comfortable speaking in spontaneous situations. So very simple ground rules for you. First, I'm going to identify four steps that I believe are critical to becoming effective at speaking in a spontaneous situation. With each of those steps, I'm going to ask you to participate in an activity. None of them are more painful than saying the tongue twister out loud. They may require you to stand up. They might require you to talk to the person next to you, but none of them are painful. And then finally, I'm going to conclude with a phrase or saying that comes from the wonderful world of improvisation. Through the continuing studies program here at Stanford for the past five years, I have co-taught a class with Adam Tobin. He is a lecturer in the creative arts department. He teaches film and new media, and he's an expert at improv. And we've partnered together to help people learn how to speak more spontaneously. We call it improvisationally speaking. And Adam has taught me wonderful phrases and ideas from improv that I want to impart to you that really stick. That's why I'm sharing them with you, to help you remember these techniques. And again, at the end of all this, you'll get a handout that has this list. So let's get started. The very first thing that gets in people's way when it comes to spontaneous speaking is themselves. We get in our own way. We want to be perfect. We want to give the right answer. We want our toast to be incredibly memorable. These things are burdened by our effort, by our trying. The best thing we can do, the first step in our process, is to get ourselves out of the way. Easier said than done. Most of us in this room are in this room because we are type A personalities. We work hard. We think fast. We make sure that we get things right. But that can actually serve as a disservice as we try to speak in the moment. I'd like to demonstrate a little of this for you and I need your help to do that. So we're going to do our first activity. We're going to do an activity that's called shout the wrong name. In a moment, if you are able and willing, I'm going to ask you to stay. And I'm going to ask you for about 30 seconds to look all around you in this environment. And you are going to point at different things. And I know it's rude to point, but for this exercise, please point. I want you to point to things and you are going to call the things you are pointing to out loud anything but what they really are. So I might point to this and say refrigerator. I might point to this and say cat. I am pointing to anything in your environment around you. It can be the person sitting next to you, standing next to you. You will just shout and shouting is important. the wrong name. So in a moment, I'm going to ask you to stand and do that. Please raise your hand if you already have the first five or six things you're going to call out. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. We stockpile. You all are excellent game players. I told you the game. Shout the wrong name. And you have already begun figuring out how you're going to master the game. That's your brain trying to help you get it right. I'd like to suggest the only way you can get this activity wrong is by doing what you've just done. There is no way to get this wrong. Even if I call this a chair, no penalty will be bestowed upon you okay because i won't know what you were pointing at you could have been pointing at the floor under the chair and you call the floor the chair and you were fine the point is we are planning and working to get it right and there is no way to get it right just doing it gets it right okay so let's try this now we're gonna play this game twice again it's for 30 seconds if you are willing and able will you please stand up you can do this seated by the way but if you're willing and able let's stand up okay in a moment i am about to say go and i would like for you to point at anything around here including me it's okay to point at me i hope it's not a bad thing you say when you point at me but point at different things and loudly and proudly call them different than what they are Ready Begin Porcupine California Salt shaker Car Library Tennis racket. Purple. Orange. Putrid. Hello. Time. Time. You can stay standing because in a mere moment we're going to do it again. So if you're comfortable standing, we're about to do it again. First, thank you. That was wonderful. I heard great words being called out. It was fun. And some of you in the back were doing it in sync, so it looked like you were doing some 70s disco dance. It was awesome. This was great. Now, let me ask you just a few questions. Did you notice anything about the words that you were saying? Did we find patterns, perhaps? Maybe some of you were going through fruits and vegetables. A few of you were going through things that started with the letter A. That's your brain saying, okay, you told me not to stockpile, so I'm going to try to be a little more devious, and I'm going to give you patterns. Same problem. When we teach that class I told you about, that improvisationally speaking class, we like to say your brain is there to help you. These things it's doing have helped you be successful. But like a windshield wiper, we just want to wipe those suggestions away and see what happens. So we're going to do this activity again. This time, try the best you can to thank your brain if it provides you with patterns or stockpiles and just say thank you, brain, and disregard them. So let's see what happens when we're not stockpiling and we're not playing off patterns. We'll do this for only 15 seconds. See how this feels. Baby steps. Ready? Begin. Toe deck. Bicycle chain. Skateboard. Bananas. Purple. Putrid. Time. Please have a seat. Thank you again. Did you notice a difference between the second time and the first time? Yes. Was it a little easier that second time? No, that's okay. We're just starting. These skills are not like a light switch. It's not like you learn these skills and then all of a sudden you can execute on it. This is a wonderful game. This is a wonderful game to train your brain to get out of its own way. You can play this game anywhere, anytime. I like to play this game when I'm sitting in traffic. It makes me feel better. I shout things out. They're not the naughty things that I want to be shouting out, but I shout out things and it helps. You're training yourself to get out of your own way. You're working against the muscle memory that you've developed over the course of your life with a brain that acts very fast to help you solve problems. But in essence, in spontaneous speaking situations, you put too much pressure on yourself trying to figure out how to get it right. So a game like this teaches us to get out of our own way. It teaches us to see the things that we do that prevent us from acting spontaneously. In essence, we are reacting rather than responding. To react means to act again. You've thought it and now you're acting on it. That takes too long and it's too thoughtful. We want to respond in a way that's genuine and authentic. So the maxim I would like for you to take from this, and again, these maxims come from improvisation, is one of my favorite, dare to be dull. And in a room like this, telling you dare to be dull is offensive, and I apologize. But this will help. Rather than striving for greatness, dare to be dull. And if you dare to be dull and allow yourself that, you will reach that greatness. It's when you set greatness as your target that it gets in the way of you ever getting there. Because you over-evaluate, you over-analyze, you freeze up. So the first step in our process today is to get out of our own way. Dare to be dull. Easier said than done. But once you practice, the game just as simple as the one we practice is a great way to do it. But that's not enough. Getting out of our own way is important. But the second step of our process has us change how we see the situation we find ourselves in. We need to see the speaking opportunity that we are a part of as an opportunity rather than a challenge and a threat. When I coach executives on Q&A skills, when they go in front of the media or whatever, investors, they see it as an adversarial experience, me versus them. And one of the first things I work on is change the way you approach it. A Q&A session, for example, is an opportunity for you. It's an opportunity to clarify. It's an opportunity to understand what people are thinking. So if we look at it as an opportunity, it feels very different. We see it differently, and therefore we have more freedom to respond. When I feel that you are challenging me, I am going to do the bare minimum to respond and protect myself. If I see this as an opportunity where I have a chance to explain and expand, I'm going to interact differently with you. So spontaneous speaking situations are ones that afford you opportunities. So when you're at a corporate dinner and your boss turns to you and says, oh, you know him better than the rest. Would you mind introducing him? You say, great, thank you for the opportunity, rather than, right? I better get this right. So see things as an opportunity. I have a game to play to help us with this. This is a fun one. The holidays are approaching. We all in this room are going to give and receive gifts. Here's how this game will work. It works best if you have a partner. So I'm hoping you can work with somebody sitting next to you. If there's nobody sitting next to you, turn around, introduce yourself. Great way to
