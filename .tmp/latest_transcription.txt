 Ultimately what computer science was, but for me, the sort of light bulb went off. And I found that, contrary to what I'd seen in high school, where I saw friends of mine like programming away in the computer lab, heads down, sort of antisocially just doing whatever it was they were doing, it really wasn't that much. I got to this particular class, in this particular place. It was much more about problem solving more generally and just learning how to express yourself in code, in different languages, so that you can actually solve problems of interest to you, even if you have no intention of being a computer scientist or an engineer, but just want to be able to solve problems. Yeah.
