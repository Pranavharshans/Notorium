 Process flow charts are used often in Lean Six Sigma. It's important for us to know these. They show us the sequence of process steps. Now before we jump in, let me mention if you're interested in a free white belt certification course, you can access one at Six Sigma Society. Right now let's talk about process flow charts. To improve a process, we first have to understand it. We have to capture it in the as-this-date. And process mapping is a key first step to understanding our process. We have to know what steps are performed. So here's some of the common symbols we could use on a process map. We could use a square or a rectangle to represent an activity, like picking an order, packing an order, shipping an order, and so on. And a diamond is going to represent a decision. And those decisions are going to have yes and no outputs. There's two paths out of them. And then we're going to use an ellipse to represent a start and an end point. And then we're going to use an arrow to represent directional flow. flow. So those four symbols on the left are going to be the most common we're going to use on ProcessMap. And the symbols on the right are still used, just probably not as often. Now the symbol at the top right is a predefined process. So let's say we draw our ProcessMap, and we have a subprocess that's been included, or maybe a series of steps that we may not fit out diagram, or may not make sense to include. It's a process that's defined somewhere else, a predefined process or a subprocess. And the final symbol right below that is a document. We could show that when a document gets created in a process, or updated perhaps. A circle could represent an on-page connector. So if we don't want to have the lines crossing all throughout our process, well, we could use connectors to connect different points of the diagram. And we could also use the symbol at the bottom off-page connector. So if we want to connect two process maps and we have different pages we use that off connector to do so Now here a simple example of a high shipment process OK so we start the process and then we pick the order And then after we pick the order we check to see if it correct If it not correct we have to go and repick it to make the issue If it is correct we move forward we pack that order we send it to the carrier and then we deliver it, and then end to that point. Now this high level process flow is sometimes called a macro process map or a management view. Now as you create a process flow, you can go into varying levels of detail. And as an example, you could take the picking the order step and probably split it out even further. But you may not need to do so. That kind of depends on who your audience is, who you're communicating this process flow to. Now what you don't see in this particular view is who does what. And that's where swim lane, another version of this process flow diagram comes in handy. And so what you can see on the left-hand side in this case are different groups or parties involved in the process. So the top swim lane represents the warehouse activities they perform, and the bottom lane represents the carrier activities that the carrier performs, like UPS or FedEx. And so when the process starts, the warehouse picks the order and checks to make sure it's accurate. And then they're going to pack the order and send it to the carrier. And then the carrier, like UPS, FedEx, or someone else is going to deliver it, and then the process is going to end at that point. These swim lanes are really useful to represent who does what. Easily seen, end of view. Now as a note here, oftentimes these process flow diagrams are not enough information to train someone in the process. There's more detail behind them. And so oftentimes you'll take a process flow diagram and put it into what's called a standard operating procedure, which provides you more information about the background of the process, why it's needed, and the specific or more detailed steps, references to other documentation or templates that are needed, that can be included in standard operating procedure. Those two things can go together. So thanks for watching. If you're interested in learning more, don't forget to check out the free Lean C...
