 In this video, I'm going to show you how you can learn anything faster than everyone else. I do this by sharing three powerful learning principles that helped me graduate from a master program at the top of my class while studying as in 10% of the time as my peers. These principles work not only for me, but also for the over 30,000 learners that I coached over the past 13 years, which means they will work for you too. And these principles are, number one, the effort time exchange, number two, the omni learner principle, and number three, the iteration effect. So let's start with number one, the effort time exchange. So if you imagine becoming a faster learner than anyone else, that probably means that for you, learning is much easier, it's much more comfortable. You can go without even thinking what most people do to try to become a faster learner so they find ways to reduce the amount of effort that they need to spend on learning. And the idea is, if I can make learning easier and require less effort, this should mean that I can then also spend less time and therefore I'm faster. When it comes to learning, this is almost always wrong. The learning happens in the brain. And your brain has to actively think about and process the information that you're learning to gain learning and memory out of it. We avoid the hard, difficult thinking associated with learning. You are avoiding the learning itself. And it's actually pretty confusing because when we're learning something, we're also using some kind of technique. For example, we might be writing notes. And the process of writing really good notes might take time and it might take a lot of effort. And some say, well, if I use some kind of AI, it might be able to do it with me faster and I don't have to put in any effort and the notes are made for me. And what happens is that we actually confuse the goal. The purpose of writing the notes was to achieve the learning, which happens in our brain, not to just have notes. So the sneaky trap that you need to be careful about is that when we reduce the amount of effort to do a task, it makes it faster to achieve the task. For example, writing a set of notes. We can achieve that faster in less time, but we're actually delaying and increasing the amount of time it would take for us to achieve the learning. And so as effort goes down, we pay for that effort with more and more time later on. And so the way to really become a faster learner is to put that effort upfront, buy back more time for yourself using effort, so actively find ways to increase the amount of learning
