 through to reading research articles and learning science or reading books on productivity business. The reason the system works so consistently and so well is because it breaks down that process of reading into two distinct stages. The first stage is the consumption period and the second stage is the digestion period. Most people think that by focusing on the first stage and consuming more information they'll be able to therefore remember and apply more information. So they focus on trying to read faster or watching lectures at triple speed or binge listening to audiobooks or watching hours of YouTube tutorials but that is not how learning works. And once we understand how learning does work you'll see why my system is so important. You see when it comes to remembering and applying information it's much less about what comes into your brain and it's much more about how how much stays in your brain. That is what the second stage, the digestion period, is all about and is the part that is often neglected. So teach your system for mastering both of these stages, which in turn increases your raw retention as well as your ability to actually use the knowledge in the way that you need to. First, we need to ask ourselves, is it even possible to remember everything you read? And the short answer is no. But here's the secret. Trying to remember everything we read should not be the goal in the first place. I mean, know this because a man who actually could remember everything. This man's name is Kim Peek and his story is so crazy that Hollywood made an entire movie about him. Kim Peek was a mega genius and his memory was ridiculous. He was able to memorize a book with such perfect recall that after reading a book one time, he would be able to write it out one time.
