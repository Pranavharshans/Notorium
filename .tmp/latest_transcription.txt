 We are often going to forget the tragedies of the past, yet the valuable lesson that we have provided by its ordinary classes and all the world learning to be rules, classes, and services. History is the one constant, and we might have screwed any new. So let's get back to the history lessons on these examples. The year was 1918, and after four years of conflict, the first World War is finally over. The desktop program plots this five crashes. The main adventure madness. The current game continues to show total Now you do the job for the cross-town, you know what we're eating before? All this is going to be very good. Yeah, I'm very good. In fact, people are learning what they need to do with their food number. I have a lot of your cheese. Yeah, I'm sorry, I don't need it. Oh, wait, what are we going to be investing? Yeah, that's it. I don't know, why do we wish we could be more? So this company comes in a true popular strategy. What's going to be doing? That's just a kind of a very easy strategy. Do not let me ask your next question. If you're a lawyer, you're not going to be a lawyer, you're not going to be a lawyer, you're not going to be a lawyer. Never let's trade with a wholesale price or in their life stages into whatever security is not that big. In fact, there's so much money to be made, people are taking a load to who've asked me before. It makes their passive-fucking interest. That way those same banks are looking to invest more money too. And soon enough they begin. In fact, borrowing money from a customer bank to cancel my stocks. But since they're waking up, no one's noticing, and if all things are going to be great well in America, I understand anyway, and that makes their top culture and proposition and rise to ads, people are making this money on the market. By 1920, America's full of love has doubled, and investments are up 280% since 1922. In fact, stocks are rising so fast, companies are having a hard time digging over just finding a stock price. Wait, that's not good. And hold on, production actually seems to be slowing down. And it's not even as many key models, and people aren't buying as many things. It looks like companies may have overestimated their growth, and now we lose their growth. And all that easy to ask is dead. Well, people have taken over quite a bit, and, uh-oh, infrastructure is starting to rise. But wait a minute, the stock market is still not. That doesn't seem right. Even though the economy is looking worse for wear under the hood investors are more than providing problems in buying some of the system that are more exceptional Sure we see a few changes for close calls but things are still largely positive and the pork still gambling on the markets But over 100 points of reason is getting louder and investor uncertainty is increasing Which brings us to October 24, 1929. Black Thursdays may have to tell. The BROI start of the great international. Investors had a great issue. Headline greening. And when markets opened, they started to sell. And I'd be in a cell. 12.9 million shares, the exact. A new record. And an opening bell in small 11%. People are selling so much that price takers can't give up the volume, so they won't believe they want their selling prices. And all of a sudden is breaking the stock market again, erasing large chunks of the American flow. And things are about to get worse. While markets were coming later that day, the Dow Jones falls 12%. And a record we set last Thursday? Yeah, we spoke again. The markets lose $20 million daily on day. Some shares are now worse. People have lost their life savings in the American's world for investors and math. And so, friends, here we are. The greatest expression, the worst economic downturn in the history of the industrialized world. The Dow Jones falls for another three years after this, losing 90% of its value for the time and people now. Many lose to their jobs as companies shut down. And it's not just investors that are hit. Remember that many of the banks flow? Well, a bunch of this lost in the markets too. the market, too. People were only getting back 10 cents for every dollar they had in their country. It's a close to the country shutdown, and that probably reaches its highest levels in US history, 24.9%. By this point, bread lines, cheap kitchens, and homelessness are common sites. Whether you invested, moral money, or even some money in a bank account, the depression found a way to review financial. Time will be tough throughout the 1930s, and fiscal intervention from Franklin Leigh was close to do little in his activity. In fact, the one of you told the rise of absurd signs in Germany that limits in Canada crisis. You think the great person wasn't just felt in America, rather with raising globalization as a tax for a felt around the world. And in the darkness, we saw the rise of Hitler, who used the despair of the German people people as a rallying call, ultimately leading to the creation of the Nazi Party and the start of the Second World War in 1939. The war created jobs in America, ironically, any more tragedy, from the start of the other. Experts can't agree on why the great impersonation was as bad as it was, but the war was not able to take away some punishment. It demonstrated just how powerful the greed and alternatively the sphere of the markets can be when they get out of control, while demonstrating the destructive potential of speculation and death. Laws would later be introduced to safeguard financial institutions and deposits, and during this time in office, Franklin D. Rosemont would introduce the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities to Stain's Commission, institutions targeted at protecting the wealth of Americans that still exist to this day. People are left to remember the hardships of the president, but we could foolishly forget the lessons it provided. Fear, greed and speculation are far from death.
