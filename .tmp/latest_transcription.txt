 question. And let me do this. So while n is less than one, so while the number is not what we want, let's just prompt the user in a loop this time for the size again. Now here too, this is better because it's only two requests for information, but clearly line six and nine are pretty much identical other than the int. And if I went in and changed the size, you know, if I add this, if I change the wording here, change it to a different language, like I have to change it in two places. That's bad. Copy, paste, bad. So what might be better? Well, it turns out there's another paradigm in C that you can use that gets around this problem, this duplication of code. It would be much nicer if I just write this code once. And I can do that using a third type of loop called a do-while loop. So it turns out in C, you can do this. If you want to get the value of a variable like n, first just to create the variable without an initial value. So int n semicolon means we know what value it has yes but that's okay we're going to add a value to it eventually then i'm going to say this do literally i'm going to open my curly braces and what do i want to do i want to assign to n the return value of get int prompting the user for size well when do you want to do that i want to do that while n is less than one and this code now achieves
