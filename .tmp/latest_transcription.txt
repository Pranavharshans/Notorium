 The past 13 years, I run a learning program called I Can Study, where I've worked with tens of thousands of learners around the world to help them reach their dream results. I'm going to compress 13 years of studying and learning advice into this one video. Number one, studying does not equal learning. You can spend a lot of time studying and get very little learning out of it. Studying is just the thing that you do. It's the way you write the notes, it's the way you read your book, the way you test yourself. They're the physical activities. We study so that it can produce learning. Learning is the outcome. It's the thing that happens in our brain that connects the dots together that turns information into knowledge learning is on your current if the information is something you can remember and you understand it deeply and you can apply it in the way that you need to apply it. So if you spend 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 hours studying but you don't have good pretension, depth of understanding and the ability to apply that knowledge after spending that time, you didn't learn, you only studied. And it's this understanding that I wish I had 13 years ago when I was desperately trying to enter into medical school and I was studying 20 hours a day, sacrificing sleep, sacrificing friends, sacrificing hobbies, relationships with everyone around me, taking a massive effort to my mental health because I was so sleep deprived just studying so much that I wish I realized that different methods of studying sit on a spectrum of effectiveness. Some methods produce almost no real learning like rereading and highlighting things. This produces like no real learning. The amount of time you need to spend on that activity. And how lucky you have to be for that to just accidentally create learning is astronomical. On the other hand, there are other techniques that produce much more learning. And the idea is that we want to get rid of the stuff that doesn't work and replace it with techniques that produce a high amount of learning. And thinking about studying not as just like this thing that you do and then if you have problems, it's like, oh, I've got problems with studying great abstractly. And thinking about it instead as, okay, I'm doing stuff, but how much learning are each of the methods I'm using producing? This shifts the focus and makes you much more targeted than being able to improve the way you learn. Number two, stop looking for study hacks. Real ones don't exist. If you go on TikTok Instagram and you search my hashtag, study, study, study, study talk, you will find hundreds of videos of people saying, use this technique and you're going to get 100% on your next test, I guarantee. And it promises you a lot in like a 30 second, one minute video. And these videos make millions of views because there are millions of people looking for this shortcut to learning. Here's the truth. If you're really being struggling to get better at learning, then the solution is not going to come from the study system. If it was that easy to solve, you would have already solved it. And most of the time, yes, sometimes there are little things that can be adjusted and tiny little tweaks that you can make to the way that you study to make it more effective. But most of the time, the big problems that people have with studying that hold them back from success are rooted in years and years of habits that have just stacked together. And you can't unlearn and retrain that overnight. So when you focus on study hacks, not only is it just not going to work and you're going to waste your time, but part of it really bugs me is when I sit down with a student and they've been using so many study hacks for so long, and they haven't found good results with them, they start believing that they're just not going to be smart enough. I remember I had this one student who was a really bright, lovely girl, trying to enter to medical school at the time, she came to my office, we had a consultation together, and I mapped out her whole learning process, and I looked at it and I said, and they said, okay, well, based on what you're doing, it seems like you've got these habits that are leading to you doing this kind of studying and thinking in this way, which means that you're probably gonna struggle with these sorts of things And I kind of created a roadmap for her in terms of how she needs to improve And I was explaining this stuff and I looked up at her and then I could see that she that she just not crying And I thought I done something wrong out there and was not prepared for this And I see what going on She said I just thought I was done And so she had been using study hacks and tips for so long that she believed in herself that since all these hacks that are promising about great results are not working, therefore the only logical conclusion there must be she's just too done. And I think that's a very sad conclusion to make just because you didn't realize the answer doesn't lie in a short come. So the natural question might be, what am I meant to look at instead? So you might look at what successful students are already going to try to copy them. Which leaves me to number three. Stop copying successful students. And I know this sounds very counterintuitive. If you see someone that's successful and you want to be successful, naturally you think if I just do what they're doing, I'm going to be just as successful. Yes, learning is a very personalized, very personalized process. And what works for one person, isn't necessarily not work for another person. And this is especially true in learning to learn because of something called deep processing. Deep processing is your ability, and a lot of this is determined genetically in early childhood experiences, and you can train it, and this is what I do, and I can study and train it, but it does take time. But deep processing is your brain's ability to connect information together and extract meaningful learning out of the information that you're consuming. When you look at someone, you say, man, they're just like a genius. They just read it. They just get everything clicks for them. What your brain is doing to make it click for them, that is deprocessing. And again, it's something that can be trained. And the reason this is important for copying successful students is because most successful students are not successful because of the techniques they use. It's not because of how they're studying. It's because they have a level of deprocessing that is, in a way, naturally, they're luckier. And they can get away with using mediocre techniques and still make it work well. The great analogy is thinking about how a car works. You've got an engine. And if you have a really powerful engine, you just floor it. You don't have to be a great driver. You're going to go really fast. And sure, maybe if you're competing against other people with like awesome cars, then you need to have that skill. But just in the general population, most people are not driving supercars. And so if you just slightly just push down on the pedal, you're going to go fast. So if someone else is in a different car, that's not as fast. Manage to WordPress hosting by Hostinger. Three super features will improve. The small engine looking at the person driving and trying to copy their technique, shifting the same way, pushing down on the accelerator, the same, everything, the technique, everything's exactly the same. They're not going to go as fast. And this is a very easy thing is that when you look at what successful students are doing, I'm not talking about like study influencers. Honestly, a lot of the time when they talk about the stuff that they're doing, they're not doing that stuff. They're just making up stuff that they're saying they're doing to create some content for it. But it's like, when you look at what they're actually doing, they're not doing half that stuff. If you look at what successful students are actually doing, and you just do exactly the same thing, millions of people do the same exact thing, those millions of people are not all getting that top result. And a lot of that comes down to the deep-processing ability. So what you should be doing instead of just copying successful students is figuring out how you can be successful yourself. And like I said, it's personalized. And it doesn't mean that if you don't have good deep-processing that you're never going to be successful. My deep-processing is not actually naturally amazing. I remember 13, 14, 15 years ago, especially when I was going through high school, I would look at these people in my class that don't seem to need to study at all. and somehow it would so good I was actively trying to do better and now a lot of people get me as an anomaly education I got the highest rate of the entire year and I studied like six weeks even less than that and people would look at that and say okay because I built different but it not like I really actively tried to build myself and my deep processing ability to get there and if that's you then you really do need to like it's depressing is not a certain level it is very difficult to be a good learner and so training that becomes a very high priority and that is not something that already successful students a lot of them are not doing that. Number four stop thinking techniques start thinking systems tell your story there's a student that I was working with a couple years ago and they were really struggling with this study for a long time and this is not just like working with me for a short amount of time, they were working with me for an entire year. So I talked to him and asked him what was going on and I kind of mapped everything out and what I realized is that he had this belief that there is this best technique and that the perfect technique is the end goal. Once you understand you can use this perfect technique, you don't need the other techniques anymore, it's just you can use that in your problems also. That is not realistic. There is no such thing as the perfect technique. You have to start thinking about techniques like tools. You cannot build an entire house with a screwdriver. It doesn't matter how big a screwdriver is, you just can't do it. Well if you do it like you're going to handle bleeding it, it took you like three years. The idea is that you have to have a toolbox of different tools that you know how to use. Each tool has its own purpose and its own limitations. The exact same thing is true for learning skills. Each technique or method or strategy has a specific purpose that it's really good for, and it has limitations. And just because something has limitations doesn't mean you should do what the student was doing and abandon it and say, oh, it must not be good enough. I'm not going to learn that. Use it for what it's good for and supplement that with other techniques that fill in those gaps. There's another side to the spectrum here, which is that some students also never think about the limitations in the first place. And so now I have a technique and they'll believe this technique is flawless. And so they will then use and abuse it to do everything. And the best example of this is flashcards. A lot of people look at flashcards based on a special repetition and active recall. And that is like their whole method of studying. Like they just have flashcards. And if it's not enough, it's not working. Then they think, what's the problem? Ah, here's the answer. More flashcards. And that's a situation where you're abusing me. Flashcards are a great technique for a specific purpose. But if you use it for something that's not good for them, you're not going to keep your results. You're wasting time. You're burning efficiency. Now, as we have established, if you want to become a better or productive learner, you need to upgrade your entire learning system. And when I say this, more students will come up to me and say, well, Justin, I don't even have a learning system. However, that is not true. Most students have a learning system. It's just not refined. So it's like most students have a toolbox of sorts. It's just that it may not be full of premium, the top of the line tools that they need to excel at a top level. Now a high leverage activity that you should do is to have your toolbox assessed by an expert. This helps you to figure out which of your tools is the weakest, but more importantly, where you should invest your time in first to get the biggest improvements in your own results. Now this is something that I do with time, and if I can see you in person, then I could give you a conversation about how you will learning toolbox that you need to work on and just do that for you once upon a day. But I would have some less time, and it would also be a way for me to just rock up to your house unannounced, just like offer you a learning toolbox evaluation. But this will help you and make you create a free learning toolbox assessment for you. It's a quiz that evaluates your time learning system and gives you a score out of 100. More importantly, it also gives you a personalized report at the end, which tells you exactly which part of your learning system I will be back, and therefore what you should learn on. It's absolutely free, and I'll leave a link in the description for you below. Now let move on back to our next study lesson Number five avoid the illusion of learning What is the illusion of learning The illusion of learning is when you do something that makes you feel like you learning but you know and this is basically the learning a little productive procrastination so one things is you know when there's something you need to do like a big task and you procrastinate but you procrastinate doing things that feel productive like organizing your room like cleaning up your desk or something like that just planning like creating a schedule and it's not the most important thing for you to do really what you need to do is just get on and do the task but we procrastinate with these other things that feel like we're making progress and we do that because it's easy and it makes us feel better about the fact that we are making progress That's basically what the illusion of learning is. It's when you are doing something and it makes you feel good because it's like, I guess this is helping me with learning, but when you actually go to measure it, it's probably not helping. There's two really common examples I see in students I work with. The first one is in just writing and rewriting notes. The amount of times that I have spoken to someone, mapped out their learning, and then they have a one hour lecture followed by two, three hours of writing notes. But then at the end of those two, three hours, they haven't learned anything. I say, well, if you were to sit in the test right now, how long do you think you should do? They say, well, terribly because I haven't learned it yet. I just printed my notes. Why did you spend three applicants writing notes and doing stuff if it's not helping you with learning? And a lot of times the answer is that it's just what they're used to doing. It's comfortable. It's an existing habit. And they don't know what else to do. They don't know how to really create effective learning. So they hide in the comfort of the illusion just saying, I'm sure if I just do this, it will help with my learning somehow. Even though you know when you really look at it, that it's not helping with your memory and your attention and your depth of understanding your ability to apply. And so if you're trapped in the illusion of learning, the answer is not just like feel terrible and panic and stay in the illusion of learning. It's to accept that you're doing something that's frankly kind of useless and learn about the alternative. There are other things that you can do. And not knowing what to do is not a good excuse. And I don't mean to call you out. And I don't mean to upset you with saying that. but I think if you really want to give yourself the best chance of success, sometimes you do have to look at things as like this is the cold hard truth. Now one of the things that you do to break up the illusion of credit is test yourself earlier and more often. I remember for most of my life, especially in high school, I would study and study for an exam and by the time I'm entering the exam I really don't know how well I'm going to do. Like usually I would know that I'm going to pass and I'm probably not going to do too badly but I have to wait for the results to find out. And that sounds really natural. But actually there isn't a good reason not to know how well you're going to do an exam before you walk in. And if you don't, that probably means you're not testing yourself early enough and often enough. I used to study, and this is how a lot of people study, is that you just spend time studying and reading a writing notes, and then a week or two before the exam, I'm doing practice tests. Or sometimes it's like the night before the exam, I'm just doing practice papers, and I'm finding these gaps, and I'm getting used to applying my dollars, and I'm going to the exam. And here's the thing is that, let's say you test yourself, and then you find all these gaps. You don't really have time to fill any of them anymore. In fact, I've been working with students that deliberately avoid testing themselves with harder questions because they know they won't be able to answer it. It's like, you're still going to have to answer it in the exam anyway. The point is, you have to find these gaps by testing yourself as early as possible. as early as possible. And one of the changes that I made that really helped with my exam results and my exam confidence is just testing myself at the end of every week and the end of every month. So on a Saturday, I would test myself on everything I learned from Monday to Friday. And then on a Saturday of every month, I would test myself on everything I learned during that month. Which would be that number one, I was finding gaps early, but the number of gaps I was finding was not that large, because I was only having a few days worth of learning to review. So it didn't take that long to fill those gaps. And then by the end of the month,
