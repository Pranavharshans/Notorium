 The best model ever created. That is not hyperbole. It is not only beating every other model on the benchmarks. I've tested it thoroughly and it is able to one-shot some of the most impressive demos I've ever seen. Look at this first one. So this is a Rubik's cube. Now it's a 3D Rubik's cube. You can generate any size of Rubik's cube that you want. And then let's scramble it. So it is actually persisting all the colors in the right spot. It is absolutely stunning. Now, some of you may be thinking, well, that's not that impressive, but I've tried this with every other model pretty much, and none of them are even able to come close to getting it working. And so you can see some of the colors are missing. The rotation doesn't look right. It's not persisting the colors during rotation. But now look, now we have a four by four cube. Everything looks right. Let's solve it. it and we can actually watch it solving it in real time. It is so impressive. So it's just going to take a minute and there we go. Completely solved and we watched it solve it. Absolutely incredible. So I wasn't sure if this was going to work so I created a 10 by 10 cube and we can scramble it up and we can really just see everything is persisting properly All right So now that it fully scrambled we can see every side Beautiful Let click solve and we can see it solving down in the bottom left And this is going to take a while. So while that's going, let me show you the benchmarks and tell you a little bit about the model. Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. This is a thinking model. It was just released a few minutes ago. It's in Google's AI studio. If you want to check it out, it is completely free. and lightning fast, and I'll show you that in a moment. Now, immediately, it is number one in the LM arena. That is essentially human voters voting on the results. Here it is, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and handily beating number two, which is Grok 3 Preview. 1443 ELO score, 1404 Grok 3 Preview. Now, as I said, this is another thinking model, meaning it outputs a bunch of tokens in its thinking phase as it continues to try different things, stick through different possible solutions to problems, and then finally gives you the output. These thinking models have proven to be much more capable at coding, reasoning, math, logic, stuff that basically has verifiable rewards. And let's look at some of the specific benchmarks now. Here's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Here's O3 Mini, the...
