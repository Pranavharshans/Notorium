 Every language has a learning curve. Like when you use Go, the learning curve is very, very simple. It's like you have to get used to some of the things, and then you do this, and then you discover some of Go's words, and then boom, you're done, right? It's pretty straightforward. Obviously, like JavaScript and TypeScript, they're also kind of a confusing language, so they do something that's like this for a little bit, and then you really get it, and then there's some other hard stuff that does this for a while. But mostly it's a pretty easy language. But Rust, on the other hand, is where things go completely wrong. So with Rust, the learning curve looks something like this. You use it and you do single-threaded Rust and you learn about the borrow checker. You're like, oh, this is easy. It's not that bad. And then you try ASync and you realize that you can't do it. And then you spend the next two years of your life trying to understand Rust, only to find out that you actually truly should have just learned half.
