 Pornography addiction. My wife and I, we separated after year 20. Because of this pornography addiction, it got to a point where I actually cheated on it. I was at a massage parlor, and I thought it was something I would never do. At year 20, she basically put me on blast and said, what is it I don't know about you? And I just got tired of lying. So I went to rehab. I would always talk bad about myself. In my head, like, you dummy, you idiot, you this, you don't always talk good about yourself. The breakthrough was, I have a picture of myself. I was six years old. And I looked at that picture of that kid. And I said, is that kid a bad kid? No. He's six. He said, at no time ever in your life did you ever stop being that little boy. It changed everything. It changed the way I saw you.
