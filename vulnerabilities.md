# Security Vulnerabilities and Mitigation Strategies

## 1. Client-Side API Key Exposure
### Issue
- API keys (Gemini, Firebase) are exposed in client-side code using NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix
- Console logging of API key in gemini-service.ts (line 30)
- Potential for key theft and unauthorized API usage

### Mitigation
- Move API calls to server-side endpoints
- Remove NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix from sensitive environment variables
- Remove API key logging
- Implement API key rotation mechanism
- Use server-side environment variables only

## 2. File System Operations Security
### Issue
- Unsanitized file operations in transcribe route
- Potential path traversal vulnerability in file writing operations
- No file size limits for audio uploads
- Temporary file handling without cleanup

### Mitigation
- Implement strict file size limits
- Add file type validation
- Sanitize file paths and names
- Implement automatic cleanup of temporary files
- Use secure temporary file creation methods

## 3. Missing Rate Limiting
### Issue
- No rate limiting on API endpoints
- Potential for abuse and DOS attacks
- Excessive API usage possibility for AI services

### Mitigation
- Implement rate limiting middleware
- Add request quotas per user/IP
- Monitor and alert on unusual usage patterns
- Implement exponential backoff for failed requests

## 4. Authentication and Authorization
### Issue
- Insufficient auth checks in some note operations
- Client-side authentication state management vulnerabilities
- Missing session validation

### Mitigation
- Implement server-side session validation
- Add middleware for consistent auth checks
- Use secure session management
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Add role-based access control

## 5. Input Validation and Sanitization
### Issue
- Limited input validation for note content
- Potential XSS through note content
- Missing sanitization for tags and user input

### Mitigation
- Implement comprehensive input validation
- Add content sanitization for all user inputs
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Validate and sanitize all API inputs
- Implement proper output encoding

## 6. Error Handling and Information Disclosure
### Issue
- Detailed error messages exposed to client
- Stack traces might be exposed in production
- Sensitive information in error logs

### Mitigation
- Implement generic error messages for clients
- Add proper error logging system
- Use error boundaries in React components
- Sanitize error messages before logging

## 7. Data Protection
### Issue
- Missing encryption for sensitive data
- No data backup strategy
- Potential data leakage through API responses

### Mitigation
- Implement encryption at rest
- Add field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Implement proper data backup strategy
- Add data access logging
- Implement proper data retention policies

## 8. Audio Processing Security
### Issue
- Unsecured audio file handling
- Missing validation for audio content
- Potential for malicious audio files

### Mitigation
- Implement audio file validation
- Add virus scanning for uploads
- Implement secure audio processing pipeline
- Add proper error handling for malformed audio

## 9. API Integration Security
### Issue
- Missing API version control
- Potential for API response manipulation
- Insecure external API communication

### Mitigation
- Implement API versioning
- Add response validation
- Use secure communication channels
- Implement proper API error handling
- Add API response caching

## 10. Frontend Security
### Issue
- Missing Content Security Policy
- Potential for client-side injection
- Insecure dependency management

### Mitigation
- Implement strict Content Security Policy
- Regular dependency updates
- Add security headers
- Implement SRI for external resources
- Regular security audits

## Immediate Action Items
1. Move all API keys to server-side only
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Add proper input validation
4. Set up security headers
5. Implement proper error handling
6. Add file upload restrictions
7. Implement proper session management
8. Set up monitoring and alerting
9. Regular security audits
10. Employee security training
