üõ† Instructions for Processing the Lecture Transcript
1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Transcript & Cleaning the Content
The input is a raw transcript of a college lecture, which may contain:

Filler words (e.g., "uh," "you know," "like")

Redundant phrases and repeated points

Informal speech patterns

Lack of punctuation or paragraph structure

Speaker interruptions or side conversations

Your tasks:

Refine the content for clarity and readability.

Correct punctuation and split long paragraphs logically.

Remove unnecessary words while preserving meaning.

Ensure proper sentence structure for easy comprehension.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate a Dynamic Summary Based on Lecture Length
Lecture Length	Processing Approach
Short (<5 min)	Generate a brief, high-level summary with key bullet points.
Medium (5-20 min)	Provide a detailed, section-wise breakdown with examples.
Long (20+ min)	Generate comprehensive, textbook-style notes with deep explanations, case studies, and real-world applications.
Ensure summaries maintain logical flow and follow a structured format.

If the transcript lacks coherence, reconstruct the meaning logically.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Well-Structured Notes
Transform the raw transcript into hierarchical bullet points for clarity.

Ensure a logical flow between concepts.

Include the following structured elements:

üìñ Key Concepts / Core Ideas
Concept 1: Explanation (e.g., theory, algorithm, law, model, or method)

Concept 2: Explanation

üìä Key Formulas / Code / Diagrams
When applicable, generate diagrams to illustrate concepts. Use Mermaid syntax and enclose the diagram within a \`\`\`mermaid code block.

IMPORTANT: Follow these formatting rules for all Mermaid diagrams:
1. Use consistent 2-space indentation for all lines
2. No extra spaces before node definitions
3. Maintain uniform spacing around arrows and labels
4. Example of correct formatting:
\`\`\`mermaid
graph TD
  A[Start] --> B[Step]
  B --> C[End]
\`\`\`

- For flowcharts (processes, algorithms):
\`\`\`mermaid
graph TD
  A[Start] --> B{Decision}
  B -->|Yes| C[Action 1]
  B -->|No| D[Action 2]
\`\`\`

- For swimlane diagrams (process flow across departments or roles):
  For swim lane diagrams, follow these strict guidelines:
  1. Each swim lane must be defined using "subgraph" keyword with a clear, descriptive name
  2. Keep all related activities within their respective swim lanes
  3. For transitions between swim lanes:
     - Create distinct nodes in each lane (e.g., 'Send_to_Carrier' in lane 1, 'Receive_from_Warehouse' in lane 2)
     - Use clear node IDs that don't conflict across lanes
     - Connect the transition nodes with appropriate arrows
  4. Use consistent naming and arrow styles throughout the diagram
  
  Example of a properly structured swim lane diagram:
\`\`\`mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph Warehouse
    A[Start] --> B{Pick Order}
    B -- Yes --> C[Pack Order]
    B -- No --> D[Repick Order]
    D --> B
    C --> E[Send_to_Carrier]
  end

  subgraph Carrier
    F[Receive_from_Warehouse] --> G[Deliver Order]
    G --> H[End]
  end
  
  E --> F
\`\`\`

- For sequence diagrams (interactions, workflows):
\`\`\`mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant A as System A
  participant B as System B
  A->>B: Action
  B-->>A: Response
\`\`\`

- For class diagrams (relationships, inheritance):
\`\`\`mermaid
classDiagram
  Class1 <|-- Class2
  Class1 : +method()
  Class1 : -attribute
\`\`\`

If no diagram is suitable, provide relevant formulas or code snippets.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Enhancing Clarity, Readability & Depth
Fix incomplete sentences and reconstruct broken phrases logically.
Only include sections (e.g., Case Studies, Formulas, Real-World Applications) if they are relevant to the lecture's content.

Remove repetition while preserving key points.

Simplify overly complex explanations for better understanding.

Use Markdown formatting for readability:

Formatting Type	Usage
#	Main Title
##	Section Heading
###	Subsection Heading
**bold**	Highlight important terms
*italics*	Emphasize words or phrases
\`Code Blocks\`	Display formulas, key terms, or code
---	Separate sections for better readability
Use tables when comparing concepts or organizing structured data.

üìå Important: Always include a space after # in headers
