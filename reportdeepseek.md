# Critical Security Vulnerability Report - Deep Seek

**Date:** 4/29/2025  
**Assessor:** Automated Deep Seek Script  
**Severity:** CRITICAL

---

## Immediate Action Required
Multiple critical vulnerabilities found in environment configuration files. These must be addressed immediately:

1. **Exposed API Keys**: Firebase, Groq, Gemini, and Dodo Payments API keys are exposed in .env.local
2. **Private Key Exposure**: Firebase service account private key is exposed in plaintext
3. **No Encryption**: Sensitive credentials stored without encryption
4. **Version Control Risk**: These secrets appear to be committed to version control

---

## Critical Findings

### 1. Exposed Secrets in .env.local (CRITICAL)
- **Files**: `.env.local`
- **Issue**: Contains multiple highly sensitive credentials exposed in plaintext:
  - Firebase API keys and service account private key
  - Groq API keys (both public and private)
  - Gemini API key
  - Dodo Payments API keys and webhook secret
- **Impact**: Full compromise of all integrated services possible
- **Recommendation**:
  - Rotate ALL exposed keys immediately
  - Move secrets to a secure secret manager (AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, etc.)
  - Implement environment variable encryption
  - Add .env.local to .gitignore if not already present
  - Audit git history and purge any committed secrets

### 2. Insecure Firebase Configuration (HIGH)
- **Files**: `src/lib/firebase.ts`, `src/payment/src/lib/firebase.ts`
- **Issue**: Config endpoint lacks authentication/rate limiting
- **Recommendation**:
  - Add authentication middleware to config endpoint
  - Implement rate limiting
  - Add response caching with short TTL

### 3. Service Account Key Exposure (CRITICAL)
- **Files**: `.env.local`
- **Issue**: Full Firebase service account JSON with private key exposed
- **Impact**: Complete Firebase admin access could be obtained by attackers
- **Recommendation**:
  - Revoke and regenerate service account immediately
  - Never store service account keys in environment variables
  - Use workload identity federation instead

## Identified Vulnerabilities

### 1. Insecure Configuration & Hardcoded Secrets
- **Firebase Configuration Exposure:**  
  - Files: `src/payment/src/lib/firebase.ts`, `src/lib/firebase.ts`
  - Issue: Possible exposure of Firebase configuration and credentials if not properly secured or managed with environment variables.
  - Recommendation: Ensure all sensitive credentials are loaded securely using environment variables and are not committed in version control.

- **Environment Variables Handling:**  
  - Files: `.env.local`
  - Issue: Check for any misconfigurations or failure to restrict access on environment files.
  - Recommendation: Verify that sensitive data is properly masked and the file is excluded from version control.

### 2. API Endpoint Security
- **Unprotected API Routes:**
  - Files: Multiple routes in `src/app/api/`
  - Issue: Potential exposure of API endpoints that may allow unauthorized access if they are missing authentication or input validation.
  - Recommendation: Implement robust authentication checks and validate all incoming data. Use middleware for consistent security enforcement.

- **Misconfiguration of Webhook & Subscription APIs:**
  - Files: `src/app/api/webhook/route.ts`, `src/app/api/subscription/cancel/route.ts`
  - Issue: Ensure that webhook endpoints are secure against spoofing and replay attacks.
  - Recommendation: Introduce token validation and rate limiting for these endpoints.

### 3. Injection & Data Validation Issues
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:**
  - Files: Various API route files and form components (e.g., `src/components/ui/CustomerPaymentForm.tsx`)
  - Issue: User inputs might not be sufficiently sanitized before processing, leading to potential injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, command injection, or XSS).
  - Recommendation: Use proper input validation libraries and sanitizers to clean all user-supplied data.

### 4. File Upload Handling
- **File Upload Risks:**
  - Files: `src/components/ui/upload-progress.tsx`
  - Issue: Consider verifying that file uploads are properly authenticated and only allow supported file types to prevent malicious file uploads.
  - Recommendation: Add robust file type checks, size limits, and storage validations.

### 5. Dependency & Library Vulnerabilities
- **Dependencies:**
  - File: `package.json`
  - Issue: Ensure that all listed dependencies have no known vulnerabilities by running regular package audits (e.g., using `npm audit` or similar tools).
  - Recommendation: Regularly review and update dependencies to address reported vulnerabilities.

### 6. Misconfiguration in Next.js Settings
- **Next.js Configuration:**
  - File: `next.config.ts`
  - Issue: Verify that configurations related to security (e.g., CSP headers, HTTPS redirections) are correctly set.
  - Recommendation: Audit the Next.js configuration for best practices in production environments.

### 7. Middleware and Access Controls
- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Files: `src/middleware.ts`, `src/context/auth-context.tsx`
  - Issue: Ensure the authentication checks in middleware and context providers are correctly applied and tested.
  - Recommendation: Consider performing security testing (e.g., penetration testing) on these critical paths.

## Recommendations & Next Steps

1. **Code Review & Testing:**  
   Conduct manual code reviews on the highlighted files to confirm vulnerability presence and assess remediations.

2. **Static & Dynamic Analysis:**  
   Deploy automated static code analysis tools (e.g., ESLint security plugins) and dynamic testing tools to identify any further security issues.

3. **Environment and Dependency Management:**  
   Audit all environment variables and dependency versions, ensuring sensitive data is secured and dependencies are updated.

4. **Security Best Practices:**  
   Update middleware, API routes, and user input validations as needed with proven security patterns.

## Conclusion

This report summarizes the potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations identified through automated inspection across the project. Corrective measures along the recommendations provided will help mitigate these risks. Further in-depth dynamic testing and penetration testing are advised for a comprehensive security evaluation.

## Updates (4/30/2025)

### Completed Security Improvements

1. **Secured AI Endpoints** (FIXED)
   - Files: `src/app/api/ai/openrouter/route.ts`, `src/app/api/ai/groq/route.ts`
   - Added authentication middleware to protect AI endpoints
   - Implemented user ID tracking for requests
   - Added rate limiting to prevent abuse

2. **Secured Transcription Endpoint** (FIXED)
   - File: `src/app/api/transcribe/route.ts`
   - Added authentication requirement
   - Implemented user ID association with transcriptions
   - Added audio URL validation to prevent SSRF attacks
   - Added rate limiting to prevent abuse

All endpoints now require valid authentication and implement rate limiting to prevent unauthorized access and resource exhaustion.
